v2ray-connection-limiter <br><br>
(v2.0.1 updated / if you have V2 please update codes on your server)<br>
with this script you can detect and ban those V2ray accounts which aren't only connected to one devices.

It's simple part i could do for the ppl who providing VPN for iranian users so they could selling VPN for more and more users. so 50 50 WIN WIN ! VPN providers getting money to get more Servers and many users Could get VPN as well lol. we should be togheder right ?

so i made something for VLESS and other protocols (vmess seems blocked in iran) which you can detect those accounts which using by more than 1 IP ! this script might has some bugs and it's possible to get more power from CPU SERVER .! so check everything first and put it on background

how it works ? 
it's finding connected IPs to user's Port and if more than specific IP counts are connected , it will disable that account . 
it counts those Ips which connecting and downloading data in same time so it doesn't count standbyed and disconnected connections

<b>Install Guide :</b><br>
1 - install python .<br>
2 - pip3 install requests and pip3 install schedule<br>
3 - install netstat (if your server doesn't have it so install it - debian : apt install net-tools)<br>
4 - put it on background => nohup python3 main.py &  (without background process : python3 main.py) <br>
5 - you can set telegram bot token + your tlg chat_id for notification as well . it's pretty clear on the code .
<br>
<b><h4>Note: </h4></b><br>
you can change Limits in line 8 >> _max_allowed_connections = 1 (1 means only one device could able to connect but i suggest to set it on 3 it works great then, becuase sometimes switching between mobileData and ADSL gonna make some issues so num 3 is better .)

<b>Note: </b> : in v2 new users will checked automatically

<b>IMPROVED: </b> and blocked users will bee unblocked when connections reduce to _max_allowed_connections
